Node Lunchables
==================

Node Lunchables are bite-sized pieces of easily digestible beginner node curriculum served up an hour at a time for about a 6 week duration. Each Node Lunchable will build off the previous one and in their entirety, come together to form a Node Bookshelf Lab. Node Lunchables assume familiarity with the javascript language and experience in at least one object-oriented language like Ruby, Python, PHP, or Java. If you have yet to familiarize yourself with javascript or just need to brush up, you might want to check out the javascript resources at the end of  of this Lunchable.

The lunchables will be lab-based (not lecture-style) and are largely instructor independent.
